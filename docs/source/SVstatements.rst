System Verilog Statements
=========================
“module” is the basic unit (block) of hierarchy in SystemVerilog and they can be reused to create other modules in hierarchical manner. The module describes the boundaries, inputs and outputs, and the functionality of the circuit block being modelled. To explain the concept of the module, a multiplexor circuit is modelled based on its gate level schematic.

Multiplexer is a combinational logic circuit which outputs the data coming from one of its inputs as defined by the value of its selection signal. For example, a two input MUX has two data inputs (in0,in1) and a selector input (sel), and it has only one output (f ) (refer Figure 1 for the circuit).

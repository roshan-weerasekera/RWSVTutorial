On System Verilog Modules
=========================

The module in SystemVerilog is the basic unit (block) of hierarchy. It describes the boundaries, inputs and outputs, and the functionality of the circuit being modelled. To explain the concept of the module, a multiplexor circuit will be modelled using its gate level schematic. Multiplexer is a combinational logic circuit which outputs the data coming from one of its inputs based on the value of its selection signal. For example, a two input MUX has two data inputs (in0,in1) and a selector input (sel), and it has only one output (f ) (refer Figure 1 for the circuit).

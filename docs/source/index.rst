System Verilog for Digital Logic Circuit Modelling!
==================================================
System Verilog is a textual mean of describing or modelling digital logic circuits and systems. The software tools available is capable of (a) simulating the models; (b) test and verify them; and (c) synthesise them to circuits to be implemented as Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) or on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). It is a digital hardware modelling language.
